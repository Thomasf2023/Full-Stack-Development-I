# Full-Stack-Development-I

<h1> Architecture <h1>

<h2> Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). </h2>

The different types of frontend development gave me differnt experience using each one. It was interesting to see how these differnt front end languages and components mixed together to create a front facing website. Express HTML allowed for html files/code to be run through templates, Javascript was for various functionality and the single-page application allowed for the website to reload without reloading whole pages at a time. 
  
<h2> Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database? </h2>

The use of MongoDB made it easy to transfer data inbetween the frontend and the backend. MongoDB is easy to use and made a good database for this project.

<h1> Functionality </h1>

<h2>How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? </h2>

Json is differnt from Javscript because JSON is just data basically. The JSON feeds data through Javascript and allows for data to come from the MongoDB.

<h2> Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components. </h2>

We started out with full HTML files loading and reloading for the webpage. One of the things that happened in this application was that we switched from that style to a single-page application. This allowed for parts of the page to be updated without updating the entire page. 

<h1> Testing </h1>

<h2> Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application. </h2>

Within the application there are various components that need to be tested. This means that the API endpoints that feed information into the application need to be tested to make sure that is is working. Security needs to be considered as well because there needs to be enough security for protection but not too much that it blocks users from using the applicaiton or parts of the application. Everything within the application should be tested to make sure for full functionality. 

<h1> Reflection </h1>

<h2> How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field? </h2>

This course has given me more insight into full stack development. It has given me experience with developing an application from the frontend and backend. It has also shown me more ways that applications can be run and the differnt components that can be put into an application to make it run more smoothly.
